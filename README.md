**Tab Inactivity Challenge:**
This project demonstrates how to track browser tab activity and update the status message based on user interaction.

**How It Works:**
1. When the tab is active, the message displays "Welcome!".
2. If the tab becomes inactive for 5 seconds, the message changes to "Tab is inactive".
3. The status resets to "Welcome!" when the tab becomes active again.
